### Getting Started

This project is written in JAVA using NetBeans IDE
Actual core logic files are present in this path= Morse-Code-Reader/Project/MorseCode/MorseCodenew/src/




The project consists of two parts 

1.GUI designing

    You will get different JForms used here for designing GUI

    All the files ending with .form are just GUI files 
2. Core Logic of Program:

    Files ending with .java file are files which consist core logic. 

    EnglishToMorse.java and MorseToEnglish.java are files that convert normal English text to Morse Code and vice-versa 

    chk.java is a file which will convert an image into Black and White image and determine if there are any dashes or dots in the image       and count them(Because Morse contains only dashes and dots).
